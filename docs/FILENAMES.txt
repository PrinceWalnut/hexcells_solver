The convention for all filenames is to be given as follows:

"{PREFIX}_game{GAME_NUMBER}_turn{TURN_NUMBER}.hxy"

where the variables {GAME_NUMBER} and {TURN_NUMBER} are 8-digit integers (leading zeros not stripped), and {PREFIX} is the path to this package's ~/data/ directory.

Solved files per turn iteration will include the following appendix before the '.hxy' extension:

"_soln"
