This is a description of the game state to be written to every file.

The critical pieces of information for every turn are given here.

BOARD:
    -The colour state of all cells at beginning of turn
        -0 -> white; 1 -> orange; 2 -> grey; 3-> blue;
    -Represented as 2D array of cell indices with their values being enumerated as above
        -Raw 2D XY coordinates
        -Each row is 1 Y-unit, and hexes in the same row are 1 X-unit from each other
            -Each row alternates X-units by 0.5
        -First cell starts at top-left and is always (0,0) with all cell indices being positive
            -First cell of second row always starts at (0.5,1)

NEIGHBOUR_DATA:
    -Number of adjacent blue cell neighbours for each grey cell
        -Is -1 for any non-grey cell and '?' grey cells
        -Some number 0-5 for any informational grey cell
    -Represented as 2D array of cell indices with their values being enumerated as above

ROW_COLLECTIONS:
    -Array of cells that satisfy a rule
        -Possible rules include an exact number of blue cells and an OPTIONAL:['contiguous', 'non-contiguous']
            -No optional rules denoted by 0, contiguous denoted by 1, non-contiguous denoted by 2
    -May have sub-row_collections that apply rules to a subset of these cells
    -Represented as an array of cell coordinates, number of blue cells, and rules enumerated by above

AREA_COLLECTIONS:
    -Given by coordinates of a cell, and the number of blue cells in an array spanned by two cells distance from that cell (excluding the cell)
    -Represented as array of all cell indices in the area (excluding the original cell) and the number of them that are blue

REMAINING:
    -Integer of number of remaining blue cells to be discovered
